# linux-club-signup
Custom form for linux club registration

This is server-side code for a custom form that I created for collecting signups for my school's linux club.
I couldn't find a good FOSS form software that worked like google forms, so I created my own custom one. I also wanted to
practice node js.

It uses node js, heroku postgres, and the bulma css framework.
